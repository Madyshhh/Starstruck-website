# Welcome to the StarStruck GitHub repository! 

This website was created by me in my free time as part of a software development project. 

StarStruck.com is a start-up business that provides a platform for users to search and purchase celebrity services, such as video messages, signed cards, voice messages, or live calls. Celebrities can register on the website and offer their services for sale, while users can search for services based on different criteria.

The website features a user registration and login system, as well as an administration login for monitoring and moderating user input. The search facility allows users to search for services offered by movie stars, athletes, musicians, or comedians, with results displaying relevant information about the celebrity and service offered. Users can tap or click on a record to view more information, such as a description and price.

Registered users can add, delete, and update their services for sale, with basic security features implemented for added protection.

This prototype version of the website does not include sales or payment facilities, and advertising is not currently implemented. However, the website is designed to be accessible and responsive for all age groups, promoting ease of use and professionalism.

Thank you for visiting the StarStruck.com GitHub repository. Please feel free to browse and explore the website's files.
